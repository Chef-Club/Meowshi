# Governance

An example of proposal passing through `Governor Meow` polling contract can be seen [here](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x89f436c0609388d8a9f3946204f0cf54965174ff613b49ec3340b4af56f865b3) (returning some MEOW from Timelock). Timelock admin was [forwarded to Meowshi holders](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa2e0db4ac2db365b475320eb22d47b141041c7cc73844770c7d4c72f3f05edf3/advanced#eventlog) following similar testing. Governor guardian was also burned, as can be seen [here](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x557692d1dcfe21a1a8b4253228bf9f45570b6d3b8779f2c416f693d3a7133fed).

To continue to experiment with defi-charged governance, and blend NFT into the mix, an NFT minter contract was deployed [here under Meowshi DAO governance](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc66b959c3bd5471d5740ddc5a6c3b20b7855b4a1#code).
